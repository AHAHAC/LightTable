# Contributing

We'd love to have your contribution. Like with Clojure and other big OSS projects, we do require you to agree to the [Contributor's Agreement](https://docs.google.com/a/kodowa.com/forms/d/1ME_PT6qLKUcALUEz1h1yerLF7vP_Rnohpb9RvMLDALg/viewform). It's as easy as a CLA can be; it's just a form that instantly enables you to contribute. Also, if your pull request is going to require some effort, please discuss it with us first. We want your hard work to count.

# Plugins

Many things are better off implemented as plugins to Light Table since plugins have the same degree of power that any code in the core does. This allows us to keep the base of Light Table small and manageable and foster a large ecosystem on a solid foundation. Instead of tracking feature/plugin requests in the core, we'll track them in the [wishlist](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/Feature-wishlist) part of the wiki.
